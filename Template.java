 * 1.ask interviewer to resolve ambiguity - what data type? how much data? what
 * assumption? who is users?
 * 1.1 [Q1] -
 * 1.2 [Q2] -
 * 1.3 [Q3] - 
 * 
 * 2.design algorithm - space & time complexity? what happen if huge amount of 
 * data? did u make right trade-off? what scenario has different trade-off?
 * 2.1 [Idea] - 
 * 2.2 [Time complexity] - O()
 * 2.3 [Space complexity] - O()
 * 2.4 [If huge amount of data] - 
 * 
 * 3.write pseudocode first, but make sure tell interviewer you will write real
 * code later
 * 3.1 Write code on paper
 * 3.2 Test code on paper
 *
 * 4.write code on a moderate pace
 * 4.1 Type code as-is on paper into computer, list all compile and other errors
 *
 * 5.test code and carefully fix mistakes - extreme case, 0, negative, null, 
 * max, min? user input error (null, negative value)? general case?
