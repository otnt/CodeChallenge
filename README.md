# Cracking code challenge

## What is this

My solutions to some code challenge as well as some data structures, design patterns, algorithms that every programmer should know.

1. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) solution go to [here](https://github.com/otnt/CodeChallenge).
2. [Lintcode](http://lintcode.com/) solution go to [here](https://github.com/otnt/CodeChallenge/tree/master/lintcode/java).
3. Frequently used data structure, go to [here](https://github.com/otnt/CodeChallenge/tree/master/DataStructure).
4. Frequently used design pattern, go to [here]().
5. Frequently used algorithm, go to [here]().
6. Other cool and interesting problems, go to [here]().
7. 

## More on this

I'm writing a series of posts on cracking code challenge. These are problems I personally think worthy thinking twice. They could both help you to be a better programmer as well as better-prepared for technical interviews.

Here is the post series. Increasing every day!

## Methods

I followed the training method written in Cracking the Coding Interview 5th, which I briefly explain below:

1. Think about what you can ask interviewer to resolve ambiguity
2. Design algorithm. Think about space & time complexity, what happen if huge amount of data, did you make right trade-off, what scenario has different trade-off?
3. Coding
 1. Write pseudocode first.
 2. Write code on paper
 3. Test code on paper
4. Type code as-is on paper into computer, list all compile and other errors.
5. Test code and carefully fix mistakes - extreme case, 0, negative, null, max, min? User input error (null, negative value)? General case?
