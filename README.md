#Methods

I followed the training method written in Cracking the Coding Interview 5th, which I briefly explain below:

1.Think about what you can ask interviewer to resolve ambiguity


2.Design algorithm. Think about space & time complexity, what happen if huge amount of data, did you make right trade-off, what scenario has different trade-off?


3.1 Write pseudocode first.

3.2 Write code on paper

3.3 Test code on paper


4.1 Write code on a moderate pace

4.2 Type code as-is on paper into computer, list all compile and other errors


5. Test code and carefully fix mistakes - extreme case, 0, negative, null, max, min? User input error (null, negative value)? General case?
